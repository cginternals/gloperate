/**
*  @brief
*    Interface that can be used for rendering stages and pipelines that
*    are intended to get rendered by a Canvas.
*
*    A render stage is a stage that renders into framebuffer targets
*    and can therefore be assigned to a viewer. Therefore, it has to support
*    interface via input and output slots which is accessed by the viewer.
*
*    A Canvas should attach to the render targets
*
*    This class can be used to instanciate the necessary inputs and outputs
*    for rendering stages. It can just be instanciated on a stage or pipeline
*    and it will add the inputs and outputs directly to the stage (the interface
*    itself is not an object in the hierarchy).
