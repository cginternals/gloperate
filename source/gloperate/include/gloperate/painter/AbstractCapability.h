/**
*  @brief
*    Base class for painter capabilities
*
*    Capabilities are used by painters to communicate their behaviour and supported interfaces.
*    For example, to receive continous updates and timing information, a painter would register
*    a VirtualTimeCapability. To signal that a painter is able to render into a supplied frame buffer
*    object, it would register a TargetFramebufferCapability. All Capabilities have a flag if their
*    value has changed that can be regarded by the using painter. Capabilities are used mainly as a
*    communication object between a painter and the outside world, it is not intended to extend
*    the functionality of a painter.

    *  @remarks
    *    This functionality can be used by a painter to determine, whether capability
    *    data has been changed since the last call. It is the responsibility of the
    *    painter to react on that change and reset this flag by calling setChanged(false).
    *    For example, the viewport capability will be marked as 'changed' whenever a
    *    new viewport is set.
